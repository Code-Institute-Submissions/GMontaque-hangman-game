							Aim of the game: Hangman is a simple word guessing game, where you
							need to guess the word before you get hung <br /><br />
							How to Play: Before the game starts you need to decide what length
							of word you wish to guess, the options range from a short six
							letter word to a more difficult ten letter word. Once you've
							decided, then you can start the game. To start the game you can
							either press a letter on your keyboad or use the in game letters
							on the screen which dispaly the full list of letters. Once you
							have guessed a letter you will see that the colour has changed
							showing that it can not be clicked or used again till you restart.
							If you have guessed a correct letter that can be found in the word
							then you will see that it gets added to a row of blank squares
							which represents the letters that you have to guess.
							<br /><br />But be careful as you only have 7 guess or lives, make
							7 wrong guesses and the game is over and you loose, but guess all
							the letters in the word and you win. For an added challenge you
							have a timer so if you think your getting good why not see how
							quickly you can guess the word.<br /><br />Restart the game: To
							restart the game simple hit the restart button
							<i class="fa-solid fa-rotate-right"></i><br /><br />Forgotten the
							rules: no wories these can be accessed by clicking on teh gear
							symbol <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i><br /><br />
							Game Music: for some extra tension and impersion you can find a
							volume button on the top left which will play the game theme tune
