							Aim of the game: Hangman is a simple word guessing game, where you
							need to guess the word to win the game<br /><br />
							How to Play: Before the game starts you need to decide what length
							of word you wish to guess, the options range from a short six
							letter word to a more difficult nine letter word. Once you've
							decided, then you can start the game. To start the game, you can
							either press a letter on your keyboard or use the in-game letters
							on the screen which display the full alphabet. Once you have
							guessed a letter you will see that the colour has changed so it
							cannot be clicked or used again till you restart. If you have
							guessed a correct letter, it gets added to a row of blank squares
							which represents the word that you have to guess.
							<br /><br />But be careful - you only have 7 r lives so you can
							only make 7 wrong guesses. If you go exceed that, the game is over
							and you lose, For an added challenge you have a timer, so if you
							think youâ€™re getting good, why not see how quickly you can guess
							the word or try a longer word to guess.<br /><br />Restart the
							game: To restart the game simply hit the restart button
							<i class="fa-solid fa-rotate-right"></i><br /><br />Forgotten the
							rules: no worries, these can be accessed by clicking on the gear
							symbol <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i><br /><br />
							Game Music: for some extra tension and immersion you can find a
							volume button on the top left which will play the game theme tune
							<i class="fa-solid fa-volume-high"></i>
